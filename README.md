## What Is DEXprimed?

DEXprimed stands for Decentralized Earth Exchange – Primed.

It connects:
- Leading AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- Public search tools and academic archives (Google, PubMed, JSTOR, arXiv)
- Earth-aligned innovation like soil batteries, off-grid energy, and native seed networks

All within one unified interface focused on:
- Open access to knowledge
- Transparent decentralized systems
- Empowering local action and human creativity
